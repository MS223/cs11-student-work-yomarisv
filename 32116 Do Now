# In comments:
# What does randint do?
#randint picks a random number from 0 to 3.
# What do the values 0 and 3 do?
# I believe that they assign the numbers you can choose from
# Try changing those numbers, rerun the program, and write down what changed.
# It picked numbers from 1 to 9
# What is the difference between random.randint(0,3) and print(random.randint(0,3))?
# random randint is assigning numbers and print(random.randint(0,3)) picks a number and prints it.
